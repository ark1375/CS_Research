## Guide to Use this Repository
1. Make sure to **PULL** before even committing anything to your local repository. This will minimize the possibility of conflict in repo.
    - Use `git pull origin main` for pulling the repo.

2. Make sure to **PUSH** every commit that you made.
    - Use `git push origin main` for pushing to repo.

3. Make sure to only modify the files on your own specified folder, do not submit changes to other files as this might cause conflict in repo.
4. Use meaningful commit messages so that the commits can be easily followed if necessary.
